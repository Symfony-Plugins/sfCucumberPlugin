converts cucumber feature files to symfony functional tests

requires php >= 5.3 for now (considering lowering that to 5.2)

this is very experimental and I'm not even sure it'll give something usable in
the end but heh, code has to be funny at times :-)

also, I don't really like the generator implementation right now, it lacks
context knowledge and needs more flexibility.
